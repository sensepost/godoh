## The following updates have been implemented from the latest current version of [godoh](https://github.com/sensepost/godoh)

* Added support for HTTP basic authentication proxy
* Added support for specifying a custom "AES key" from command line (used to encrypt data blobs in communications)
* Added support for specifying a custom "User-Agent" (default: Edge 44 on Windows 10) from command line
* Added Blokada & NextDNS providers support
* Fix issues with Quad9 provider

## introduction

`godoh` is a proof of concept Command and Control framework, written in Golang, that uses DNS-over-HTTPS as a transport medium. Currently supported providers include Google, Cloudflare but also contains the ability to use traditional DNS.

## installation

All you would need are the `godoh` binaries themselves. Binaries are available for download from the [releases](https://github.com/sensepost/goDoH/releases) page as part of tagged releases.

To build `godoh` from source, follow the following steps:

* Ensure you have Go 1.13+
* Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/sensepost/goDoH.git`
* Run `make key` to generate a unique encryption key to use for communication
* Build the project with one of the following options:
  * `go build` which will drop you a new `godoh` binary for the current architecture
  * `make` which will drop binaries in the `build/` directory for various platforms
